# Dungeon Game

## Description
Dungeon Game is a Java application that helps a knight rescue a princess from a dungeon. The knight must navigate through a grid of rooms, some of which contain demons that reduce the knight's health, while others contain magic orbs that increase the knight's health. The goal is to determine the minimum initial health the knight needs to successfully rescue the princess.

## Installation
To run the Dungeon Game application, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/gade789/Dungeon-Game.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd dungeon-game`
3. Compile the Java source files: `javac DungeonGame.java`
4. Run the application: `java DungeonGame`

## Usage
The DungeonGame class contains the `calculateMinimumHP` method, which takes a 2D dungeon array as input and returns the minimum initial health required for the knight. Modify the dungeon array in the `main` method to customize the dungeon layout.
